# Terrain Recognition using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a terrain recognition system using deep learning. The primary goal of this project is to detect, classify, and predict terrain conditions, with a specific focus on roughness and slipperiness. Leveraging the Xception architecture and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our model aims to enhance terrain understanding in various applications.

## Key Features

- **Terrain Classification:** The model can accurately classify diverse terrain types, including Grassy, Rocky, Sandy, and Marshy.

- **Prediction of Terrain Characteristics:** In addition to classification, the CNN-based model predicts the roughness or slipperiness of the terrain, providing valuable insights for applications such as autonomous navigation and outdoor activity planning.

- **Efficient Architecture:** We have chosen the Xception architecture for its efficiency and effectiveness in processing visual data.

- **Robust Training Dataset:** The dataset has been meticulously curated to include a variety of terrain types, ensuring the model's robustness.
